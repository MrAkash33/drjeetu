        <p class="about-sub-heading my-2">
         I am Jeetu Nayak, a committed and skilled healthcare professional with a robust background in both pharmacy and physiotherapy. With four years of experience as a Doctor of Pharmacy, I have dedicated my career to improving patient outcomes through a blend of medical expertise and compassionate care. My academic journey began at Bhuvneswar University in Odisha, where I earned my doctorate in pharmacy. This rigorous program equipped me with a deep understanding of pharmaceuticals, including their effects, interactions, and proper usage, which is crucial in providing effective patient care.

        <p class="about-sub-heading my-2">
         In addition to my pharmacy credentials, I hold a diploma in physiotherapy from Lucknow University. This dual qualification has allowed me to approach healthcare from a holistic perspective, understanding not only the pharmacological needs of my patients but also their physical rehabilitation requirements. My education in physiotherapy has provided me with valuable insights into musculoskeletal health, enabling me to assist patients in managing pain, improving mobility, and enhancing their overall quality of life.
